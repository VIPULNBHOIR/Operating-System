# Operating-System-Lab

Prerequisite: Knowledge on Operating system principles

Lab Objectives:

1 To gain practical experience with designing and implementing concepts of operating
systems such as system calls, CPU scheduling, process management, memory management,
file systems and deadlock handling using C language in Linux environment.

2 To familiarize students with the architecture of Linux OS.

3 To provide necessary skills for developing and debugging programs in Linux environment.

4 To learn programmatically to implement simple operation system mechanisms

Lab Outcomes: At the end of the course, the students will be able to
